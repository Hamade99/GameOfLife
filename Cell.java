/*
This class represents one cell in the Game of Lifeâ€™s playing field.  It uses the State pattern to represent being alive or dead.
(In fact, since this is the only thing it represents, the class is a bit superfluous and could be straightforwardly replaced by the CellState class.
However, it is a part of this design to illustrate the use of the State pattern more clearly AND because it will make one of next times refactoring much easier.
